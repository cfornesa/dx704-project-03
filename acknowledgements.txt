I asked ChatGPT about what was incorrect for my Part 2:

My Prompt:
What does it mean to get this error?  Which value is incorrect and which one should I aim to get?
Test Failed: 1.5752073596631015 != 1.8255111545554437 within 7 places (0.2503037948923421 difference) : Data row 0 of history.tsv has reward not matching action.

ChatGPT Response:
That error message is really specific:

Test Failed: 1.5752073596631015 != 1.8255111545554437 within 7 places
Data row 0 of history.tsv has reward not matching action.

What it means

The grader re-ran your code with the same environment and seed.

For the first row in your history.tsv:

Your file has reward = 1.5752073596631015

The grader expected reward = 1.8255111545554437

The actions matched, but the reward value didn’t. That’s why the message says “reward not matching action.”

Why it happens

This usually means:

Mismatch in RNG control:
You seeded NumPy (or np.random.seed) but forgot to pass a controlled RNG into scipy.stats.beta.rvs or into the bandit. That changes the random sequence, so the bandit yields different rewards than the grader’s reference run.

Mixing RNGs:
If you use np.random.seed(...) globally and a separate np.random.default_rng, you’ll get different sequences.

Saved the wrong thing:
You must log the reward you got directly from bandit0.get_reward(action) for each step, not from any estimate or probability list.

Which value is “correct”

The grader’s value (1.8255111545554437) is the one you must aim for.

Your file’s value (1.5752073596631015) is off because the random sequence drifted.
